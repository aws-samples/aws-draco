# Testing

## Events for use in the Console

The folder `events` contains samples of events that are useful when testing Lambda
functions from the console. This is an alternative to using the `rake event:` tasks.

## Command Line Unit Testing

First run `npm install`

Then run `bundle exec rake test` to invoke the unit tests for the various lifecycle policies.

These use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com).

### Generate Test Snapshot data

The `Policy()` function in file `retention.js` has been designed with testing in mind. It accepts a list of
snapshots and return the same list with a flag `retain` set to `true` or `false` depending
on the policy. You can generate test data fixtures using the script `scripts/gen.rb`.
These should be stored in `test/fixtures`.

### Seeing the effect of a Retention Policy

If you run the unit tests with the environment variable DEBUG=1 then each Policy test will
output the snapshots it will preserve from a synthetic set of dailies. It labels each one
with the appropriate day, date, week, month and year. Execute the tests like so:

    DEBUG=1 bundle exec rake test

A sample output for the _SemiMonthly_ policy:
